# MINESWEEPER
Got bored so I decided to follow along on a video for a simple minesweeper game. Credits go primarily to this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9JP8uuQqP0. I experimented with some things out of curiosity and added some comments for my own understanding. 

## Future features
- Custom size of grid
    - Need to scale cells appropriately by changing the css grid in #minesweeper-board
    - Add html input box for this
- Add right-click option to place flag on cells
