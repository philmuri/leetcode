# MINESWEEPER
Got bored so I decided to follow along on a video for a simple minesweeper game. Credits go primarily to this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9JP8uuQqP0. I experimented with some things out of curiosity and added some comments for my own understanding. 

## Future features
